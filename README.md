## Productiview v1.0.0 beta features

- Bookmarks list: Save your bookmarks in a better way. Create a collection of all your important links. Jump faster without missing or getting lost in some confusing UI.
- Google search / url input: Feel like home! You can continue searching on Google or can directly jump to a website.
- Pomodoro: The tried and tested Pomodoro is here. 25 mins of work, 5 mins of break. This technique keeps you away from daily burnouts while keeping your thoughts fresh and active. The Pomodoro utility comes with pleasant notification sounds along with desktop notifications so you can focus on your work without checking the timer.
- Audio player: Speaking of freshness, here's an integrated music player that plays the sounds of nature. Productiview comes with three different nature sounds: Rain, River and birds. Play the sounds during your break time or work along with the sounds.
- Settings menu: The settings menu is as soothing as the view. Edit your view and make your Productiview truly yours!
